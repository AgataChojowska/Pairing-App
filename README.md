# Pairing App
This app finds all pairs of natural numbers, the sum of which is a target. A number used once to create a pair cannot be part of another.
The first number of the pair should not be greater than the second. 
Input data: Set of N natural numbers with values from 0 to 12

Example:
target = 12
Input:
[4, 8, 9, 0, 12, 1, 4, 2, 12, 12, 4, 4, 8, 11, 12, 0]
Output (Pairs of numbers that add up to target = 12):
[0, 12], [4, 8], [4, 8], [1, 11], [0, 12].
